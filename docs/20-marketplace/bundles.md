# Bundles

## Purpose
Bundles create a premium, curated feel and reduce brand-safety risk.

They also simplify buying: advertisers pick bundles rather than individual apps.

## Example bundles (starter)
- Indie Utilities
- Creator Tools
- Productivity
- Personal Finance
- Developer Tools (optional; can be smaller)

## Bundle rules
- Each bundle has:
  - description and inclusion criteria
  - a base price for weekly slots
  - a slot availability calendar
- Keep bundles stable; avoid frequent reshuffles.

## Inclusion criteria (examples)
- Subscription-based or freemium apps with real upgrades
- Consistent UX quality
- Reasonable ad placement (non-intrusive)
- Compliance with privacy + creative policy

## Publisher controls
- Publishers can opt out of certain categories or advertisers (subject to policy).
- Competitor exclusion is possible but should be constrained to avoid abuse.

## Operational note
In early phases, bundles are **invite-only / curated**.
As the network grows, allow applications but keep review.
