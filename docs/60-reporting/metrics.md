# Reporting & Metrics (Aggregate)

## Advertiser dashboard
- Spend by day/week
- Impressions, clicks, CTR
- Bundle performance
- Optional: top apps/placements (only if publisher opts in)
- Campaign status and upcoming slots

## Publisher dashboard
- Revenue (cash + credits, if enabled)
- Fill rate
- Impressions, clicks, CTR (aggregate)
- Placement-level performance
- Controls: enable/disable placements, caps, category/tags

## Privacy thresholds
- Do not display rows with very small counts (e.g., <50 impressions or <5 conversions)
- Aggregate to day/week levels by default

## Data retention (suggested)
- Raw event logs: short retention (e.g., 30–90 days) for audits and fraud checks
- Aggregates: longer retention
