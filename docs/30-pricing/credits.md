# Credits System

## Goal
Bootstrap demand and reduce cold-start friction by turning publishers into advertisers.

## How credits are earned
- When a publisher shows ads, they can earn credits automatically (Option B).
- Optionally give signup/integration credits (e.g., $25) that expire in 30 days.

## How credits are spent
- Credits can be used to purchase daily/weekly slots like cash.
- Credits are applied at checkout; any remainder can be paid via card.

## Policies
- Credits may expire (to encourage early participation).
- Credits are non-transferable.
- Credits are refundable only in narrow cases (billing errors).

## Conversion to cash (optional)
- Allow conversion after a waiting period (e.g., 90 days) to reduce arbitrage.
- Limit monthly conversion amounts early if needed.

## Anti-gaming
- Require integration to be live with real traffic before issuing large credits.
- Cap initial promotional credits.
