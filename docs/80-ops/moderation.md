# Moderation & Operations

## Early phase posture
- Invite-only publishers and advertisers
- Manual review for:
  - new advertisers
  - new creatives
  - bundle inclusion

## Workflow
1. Creative submitted → lint checks pass/fail
2. Human review (quick checklist)
3. Approve → eligible to serve
4. Reject → explain reason + allow edits

## Kill switch
- Disable a creative or advertiser instantly
- Propagate to serving layer quickly (cache busting strategy)

## Reporting issues
- Detect anomalies (CTR spikes, click bursts)
- Hold payouts if suspicious until reviewed

## Publisher disputes
- Clear policy for competitor exclusions
- Clear policy for removal requests
