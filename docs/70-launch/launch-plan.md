# Launch Plan (Avoid Cold Start)

## Phase 0 — Seed supply (2–3 weeks)
Target: 20–30 iOS apps, each with 1–2 placements.

Pitch to publishers:
- “Tasteful sponsor cards, no tracking, you control density.”
- Early perks: temporary better revenue share or guaranteed minimum payout.

Deliverables:
- SDK integration docs
- Example SwiftUI SponsorView
- Publisher dashboard MVP

## Phase 1 — Bootstrap demand with credits (closed-loop)
Make every publisher a potential advertiser:
- Give integration credits (e.g., $25) that expire in 30 days
- Or pay publishers partly in credits (Option B)

Outcome:
- Real campaigns appear quickly
- Publishers experience “the network works” without waiting for external advertisers

## Phase 2 — Curated advertisers (invite-only)
Target: 15–25 advertisers (indie subscriptions, utilities, dev tools, creator tools).

Sell:
- Weekly slots in 3–5 bundles
- White-glove onboarding: help with copy and creative

## Phase 3 — Publish rate card + availability calendar
- Public bundle pricing
- Public Monday repricing rules
- Calendar shows sold-out weeks (scarcity signal)

## Phase 4 — Self-serve with guardrails
Only after:
- creative lint is solid
- moderation workflow exists
- reporting is stable
- kill-switch + “report ad” pipeline works
